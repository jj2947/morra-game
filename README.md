# Morra Game
Implemented the Morra hand game which is played by two players - a human player and an AI player which will use 3 different strategies. 

Both players simultaneously show a number of fingers (between 1 and 5) and simultaneously call out a guess of the sum of fingers displayed by both players. If a playerâ€™s guess is equal to the actual sum, this player scores a point. If both players guess the actual sum neither of them score a point. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined score. 

## AI Strategies
The AI switchs between 3 different strategies depending on the difficulty level of the game and the round number. These strategies determine the fingers and sum the AI player chooses.
